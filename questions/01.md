# Static vs Dynamic Sites

Front end sites created with Create React App are an example of **static sites**.

## Correct

True

> Right! Remember, the difference between **static sites** vs **dynamic sites**
> is whether or not the content is built dynamically for every request to the
> server. Since applications created using Create React App are ultimately just
> pre-built HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, they fit the definition of a
> **static site** (even though they can have a very dynamic user experience).
