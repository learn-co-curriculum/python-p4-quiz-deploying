# Environments

When developing a Flask application, which of the following should be **the
same** in your development and production environments?

## Correct

Python version

> Correct! You should use the exact same version of Python in development and in
> production. Since new Python versions have new features, as well as fixing
> security issues in older versions, it's critical to use the same version in
> both environments.

## Correct

Database software

> Right! It's generally a best practice to use the same database software
> locally as you use in production, since there are a few key differences
> between SQL database software (like SQLite and PostgreSQL).

## Incorrect

Operating system

> It's actually common to deploy your Flask application to a system that runs a
> different OS than you may be using locally. For example, OSX developers can
> still deploy Flask applications to platforms like Heroku that run Linux
> without issues in most circumstances.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
